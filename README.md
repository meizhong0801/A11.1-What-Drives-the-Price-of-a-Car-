# A11.1-What-Drives-the-Price-of-a-Car-
This project analyzes 426,000 used car listings to identify the key factors influencing vehicle prices and develop a predictive pricing model. Our goal is to provide data-driven insights that help used car dealerships optimize pricing strategies and inventory management.

# Key Findings
Using machine learning models, we determined that these features impact pricing the most: year, mileage, model, condition, title status, transmission type, fuel type.
Newer cars command higher prices.
Lower mileage vehicles are valued significantly higher.
Well-maintained vehicles (better condition ratings) sell for more.
Salvage title cars are much cheaper than clean titles.
Automatic transmission & fuel efficiency influence pricing
